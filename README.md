TODO:

0. Figure out how to set the badge on the app.dock from react

2. use redux and saga to continually fetch data
2. Pop up notifications on new submissions we don't know about
3. If someone uses google auth, need to get their auth-token from the newline
   and paste in
4. Move off of less
5. more better stylers
